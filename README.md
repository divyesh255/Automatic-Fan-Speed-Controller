# Automatic Fan Speed Controller Project

Welcome to ny project on **Automatic Fan Speed Controller**. This project demonstrates a system that adjusts fan speed based on temperature changes using a thermistor, an op-amp (IC741), a relay switch, and an AC voltage capacitor. This setup ensures efficient cooling tailored to environmental conditions.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to utilize a thermistor for accurate temperature measurement, which then influences the speed of a fan through a control circuit. This setup mimics real-world applications where automatic temperature regulation is crucial for maintaining comfort and efficiency.
